In this research project focus on Ghana, I’m working on classifying sickle cell anemia using deep learning techniques to differentiate between anemic and non-anemic cases. For the first experiment, I used ResNet50 as the base model to establish a baseline performance. Moving forward, I wanted to explore more advanced architectures, so in the second experiment, I designed a custom multilayer model by combining EfficientNetV2B0 and MobileNetV3Small. This allowed me to leverage the strengths of both architectures—EfficientNetV2B0’s scalability and MobileNetV3Small’s efficiency—to improve classification accuracy.

For the third experiment, I took it a step further by creating an even more sophisticated multilayer architecture that integrates EfficientNetV2B0, MobileNetV3Small, and ResNet50V2. This combination was aimed at enhancing the model’s ability to capture diverse features and improve generalization. Each experiment builds on the previous one, allowing me to systematically evaluate and refine the performance of the models. My goal is to develop a robust and accurate deep learning system that can assist in the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
